Just researching. I thought the only way to mist was with a pump and a misting head/nozzle that works with enough pressure. However, I realized that would not work because I would need to pump air back in with another pump to not create a vacuum since peristaltic and submersible pumps are basically air tight. Also, those low-voltage pumps are not able to provide the necessary pressure for misting nozzles properly, and they are super loud.

I high-key thought this project was cooked and started looking at other ideas, until I finally understood what all those mistmakers on Amazon worked with: piezo discs/piezo elements. Uniquely, these are just ceramic discs that vibrate a lot and don't need a lot of pressure. With just a bit of capillary action, it can atomize any water it touches.

I planned on just grabbing the humidifier control board off the internet and just soldering it to the power supply and the fun, but I kinda feel that's chickening out of a challenge, even though the board is kinda cheap lol.

I primarily took inspiration from the following 2 videos. I'm not the most experienced in circuitry, so these were super helpful, especially because I still wanted to create a PCB myself.

However, I will probably actually make the PCB later after finding what parts I specifically should use and doing out some of the easier portions of this project.
